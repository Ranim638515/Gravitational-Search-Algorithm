# 🌌 Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)

This project implements the **Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)** in Python, a metaheuristic inspired by the law of gravity and mass interactions.

## 📖 Description
- Agents represent candidate solutions with a mass proportional to their quality (fitness).
- Heavier agents attract lighter ones through gravitational forces.
- Over iterations, agents converge toward the optimal solution.

## ⚙️ Features
- Object-oriented implementation of GSA
- Benchmark functions: Sphere, Rastrigin
- Visualizations:
  - Convergence curve (fitness vs. iterations)
  - Agent trajectories in 2D
  - Mass distribution
  - Function landscape in 2D
